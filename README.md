## 3D Technology
There are three 3D Sensing technologies based on computer vision.

| Technology | Distance | Computing Power | Accuracy|Application|
|------------|----------|-----------------|---------|-----------|
|Structure Light| 0.3m~1.5m|High| 1% @ 0.5m|Face Recognition(Apple FaceID)|
|Time of Flight| 0.3m~5m|Low|2% in 1.5m|Gesture Control / Body tracking|
|Stereo| 0.3m~1.5m|High| 1% @ 0.5m| Face Recognition / Gesture Control|

## Why 3D Sensing?
For face recognition, there are lots of companys developed matured Algorithm for RGB 2D camera Face Recognition.<br>
GiS focus on structure light due to higher accuracy which can also provide better face recognition accuracy. 
* Human face 3d shape detection
* Anti-mask Solution

## GiS provide
In this case, GIS provide Real 3D Face Recognition Hardware & SDK.<br>
SDK is now compatible to  Ubuntu/ Windows.<br>
