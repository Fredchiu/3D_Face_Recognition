# 3D_structure_light
From Y2018 till now, I'm a Project Leader/Manager for this 3D sensing technology.
I would like to present my job in this file.

## 3D Technology
| Technology | Distance | Computing Power | Accuracy|Application|
|------------|----------|-----------------|---------|-----------|
|Structure Light| 0.3m~1.5m|High| 1% @ 0.5m|Face Recognition(Apple FaceID)|
|Time of Flight| 0.3m~5m|Low|2% in 1.5m|Gesture Control / Body tracking|
|Stereo| 0.3m~1.5m|High| 1% @ 0.5m| Face Recognition / Gesture Control|

## Why 3D Sensing?
For face recognition, there are lots of companys developed matured Algorithm for RGB 2D camera Face Recognition.
Using 3D camera(Depth Camera) will get more information from new direction.
Just like the photos below:
